# Bloom Filter

# Introduction

> A Bloom filter is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure,  
> conceived by Burton Howard Bloom in 1970,  
> that is used to test whether an element is a member of a set.  
> False positive matches are possible, but false negatives are not.

???
* no general-purpose data structure
* membership test
* a Bloom filter only has two function: _add_ and _test_
* elements can't be deleted (counting bloom filters)
* no element retrieval or traversal

???
* You don't always get the right answer
* Is element within the bloom filter?
    * Propably there
    * Definitely not
* FPR increases with number of elements

???
* Doesn't store element itself
* User-defined fixed size

---

# How it works

* bit array of size _m_
* _k_ hash functions to calulate array positions
* add(e): set the bits
* test(e): check if bits are set

# Sizing

Trade-off: memory usage vs. false positive rate

> ![m = - ( n * ln(p) ) / ln(2)^2](img/formula_size.png)
>   
> _n_: estimated number of elements  
> _p_: false positive probability  
> _m_: required bit array length  
   
   
Example:

* n=1,000,000
    * FPR 10% ~= 4800000 Bit ~= 600 kByte
    * FPR 0.1% ~= 14400000 Bit ~= 1.8 MByte

# Hash functions

Optimal number of hash functions:

> ![k = (m/n) * ln(2)](img/formula_hash.png)
>   
> _m_: bit array length  
> _n_: estimated number of elements  
> _k_: optimal number of hash functions 

Typical 7..15

Hash function selection:

* random distribution, fast calculation
* different hash functions or same hash functions with different salts
* MurmurHash, Fowler-Noll-Vo

---

# Use cases

* Databases


* Caches


* K/V Stores
    * HBase
    * Cassandra


* Networking


* Chrome Browser

# Tricks

* Folding
    * halve in size
    * bitwise OR 1st and 2nd half
    * precondition: size is a power of 2


* Merging (Union)
    * precondition: 2 Bloom filters with same size and hash functions
    * bitwise OR 


* Intersection
    * Measure 'similarity' 


---

# Variants

* Counting Bloom filters
    * Allow implementation of delete operation


* Scalable (dynamic) Bloom filters
    * Adapt to numbers of stored elements


* Stable Bloom filters
    * For (infinite) streaming applications, evict old state
